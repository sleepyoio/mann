  <h2> TIMELINE OF COMPUTERS </h2>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

 
  <p class="light">1600s-1673</p>
  <p> Analog computers gained popularity as devices for mathematical and statistical computations, using methods like logarithmic expressions, statistics, and decimals. John Napier invented the manually operated Napier's Bones calculator. The first automated calculator, the Pascaline, was created by French mathematician Blaise Pascal. This device was later improved by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who developed the Stepped Reckoner, also known as the Leibniz wheel. </p>
  <p class="dark">1800s - 1890</p>
    Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a loom using wooden punch cards to automatically design woven textiles, a concept later adopted by early computers. Mathematician Charles Babbage created a steam-powered calculator and developed the difference engine to perform a wide range of computations, from simple math to complex astronomy. Herman Hollerith invented punch card technology for the 1880 U.S. census. Lady Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program, consisting of user-generated instructions, taking three years to complete.</p>
  <p class="light">1900s-1950</p>
<p> Alan Turing proposed the idea of a universal machine. Hewlett-Packard was founded by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in a Palo Alto, California, garage, where they initially developed the HP 200A Audio Oscillator. George Stibitz suggested using a delay-based calculator for a project. In 1947, Bell Laboratories' Walter Brattain, William Shockley, and John Bardeen invented the transistor. The Standards Eastern Automatic Computer (SEAC), built in Washington, DC, became the United States' first operational stored-program computer.






</p>
  <p class="dark">1960s-1970</p>
<p> The American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII) introduced the official computer character encoding standard. Douglas Engelbart demonstrated a prototype of the modern computer, featuring a mouse and graphical user interface (GUI). Alan Shugart and a team of IBM engineers created the floppy disk, allowing data sharing between computers. With the formal availability of personal computers, the Scelbi & Mark-8 Altair, IBM 5100, and Radio Shack's TRS-80 were among the first on the market. MicroPro International introduced WordStar, a word processing application.






</p>
  <p class="light">2000-2010</p>
<p> In 2000, the USB flash drive was first released, providing a new method for data storage. Apple introduced the Mac OS X software platform, followed shortly by Microsoft's release of Windows XP. Apple then launched the MacBook Pro, their first mobile Intel-based dual-core computer. Microsoft later released Windows 7.</p>
